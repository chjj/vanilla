# vanilla

Through a lot of evolution, __vanilla__ has become my personal framework. It's 
modeled after connect/express and Tim Caswell's stack/creationix middleware. 
It is here to give me total autonomy over my backend. It's kept in line with 
connect/express api to ultimately ensure portability of code. Use if you care to.
